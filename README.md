some examples of my work on data analysis, visualization and management with python includes:

-- drtv study : drtv is a fundraising channel where organizations make media buying for showing videos and collect leads via sms. 
Then they try to convert leads into subscriptions trough telefundraising operations. Here I analysed anonymous drtv data.

-- data transfer job from remote database

-- get excel file via ftp convert to csv load into mysql table
