# operations-and-analysis
some examples of my work on data analysis, visualization and management with python includes:

-- drtv study : drtv is a fundraising channel where organizations make media buying for showing videos and collect leads via sms. 
Then they try to convert leads into subscriptions trough telefundraising operations. Here I analysed anonymous drtv data.

-- print query result as html table: here I take user input and with these inputs I query database and print the result to 
the browser

-- send email with python

-- FantasyBasketball: here I analysed made up Euroleuge basketball data and build models to predict player price. 

-- data transfer job from remote database

-- get_excel_file_via_ftp_convert_to_csv_load_into_mysql_table 

-- handle_post_request_with_python_deploy_on_apache2.py 

--  turkey_sound  : here I analysed a kaggle competition which is about identifying turkey sound using audio embedded 
youtube videos
